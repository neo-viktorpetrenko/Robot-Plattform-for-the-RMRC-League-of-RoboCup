## Suspension Design
The Suspension of this platform is inspired by the now discontinued Dagu Wild Thumper platform. It uses torsion springs attached to rotating motor enclosures to ensure contact with uneven ground.  Two enclosures on each side are connected with a nylon string to prevent the springs from rotating the enclosures too much.
